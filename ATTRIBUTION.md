## Original Work

This project is based on and adapted from:

**Project**: Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning using Transformers and LoRA  
**Author**: Nick Renotte  
**Original Repository**: https://github.com/nickrenotte/lora-finetuning  
**License**: MIT License  
**Video Tutorial**: https://youtu.be/D3pXSkGceY0  

## Adaptation Details

### What We Kept
- Core data generation logic and workflow
- PDF processing approach using Docling
- OpenAI API integration patterns
- Quality assessment methodology
- Basic project structure and concepts

### What We Modified/Enhanced
1. **Security & Configuration**
   - Removed hardcoded API keys
   - Added environment variable support
   - Implemented YAML-based configuration system

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** 
   - Fixed Windows/Linux/macOS path handling
   - Updated file system operations
   - Improved path construction throughout

3. **Code Organization**
   - Modern Python packaging (pyproject.toml)
   - Modular configuration management
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

4. **Documentation & Usability**
   - Comprehensive README with setup instructions
   - Example configuration files
   - Setup scripts for easy initialization

5. **Additional Features**
   - HuggingFace dataset integration utilities
   - Automated dataset card generation
   - Enhanced batch processing controls

6. **Complete Training Pipeline**
   - Added comprehensive LoRA training script
   - Optimized training configurations
   - Support for multiple base models
   - TensorBoard integration for monitoring
   - Model evaluation and checkpointing

## License Compatibility

Both the original work and this adaptation are released under the MIT License, ensuring full compatibility and proper attribution.

## Relationship Type

This is a **derivative work** - we copied, modified, and enhanced the original codebase to create a complete end-to-end LoRA fine-tuning pipeline that includes both synthetic dataset generation and model training components.
