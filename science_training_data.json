The performance of OPLECm has been tested on a four-component suspension spectral data set and one publicly available benchmark spectral data set. Experimental results reveal that OPLECm can achieve satisfactory quantitative results from the spectroscopic measurements of heterogeneous mixtures. Compared with other existing methods designed for the same purpose, OPLECm has features of implementation simplicity and wider applicability as well as better performance in terms of quantitative accuracy, and therefore has great potential in quantitative spectroscopic analysis of complex heterogeneous systems.",
